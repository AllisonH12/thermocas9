# V2.5 Self-Review — differential-protection probabilistic mode

*Date: 2026-04-20. Audit scope: commit `df35d3b`. Reviewer: self.*

This document is the post-hoc audit of V2.5 before any public framing. It
records what was built, what is sound, what is fragile, and what should
happen before V2.5 could become a released default. The executive verdict
is **experimental-on-main, do not tag, do not promote**.

---

## 1. What V2.5 adds

A new, opt-in `probabilistic_mode = "tumor_plus_differential_protection"`
replaces the threshold-based `p_protected_normal` with a differential factor:

```
p_diff(δ) = P(β_normal − β_tumor > δ)
```

computed under an independent-normal approximation on the tumor / normal
summary statistics already in `MethylationObservation`:

```
σ_k   ≈ IQR_k / 1.349           (k ∈ {tumor, normal}; floor at 0.05)
σ_Δ²  = max(σ_t, floor)² + max(σ_n, floor)²
P(Δ>δ) = 1 − Φ((δ − (μ_n − μ_t)) / σ_Δ)
```

The new composite is

```
p_therapeutic_selectivity = p_targ × p_diff × p_trust
```

compared to the V0.4.0 default `p_sel = p_targ × p_trust` (tumor_only) and
the deprecated V2 composite `p_sel = p_targ × p_prot × p_trust`.

`differential_delta` is a new cohort YAML key (default `0.2`) consulted only
when the mode is differential; the other modes ignore it.

---

## 2. Scientific motivation — was the critique of `p_prot` correct?

**Yes.** Phase 5b ablation on the MCF-7/MCF-10A surrogate (GSE77348) showed
`p_protected_normal` alone at AUC 0.384 / 0.343 — anti-predictive — and the
`p_targ × p_prot` pair at AUC 0.503 / 0.488 — essentially random. The root
cause is the semantics: `p_prot = P(β_normal > 0.5)` assumes the *normal
comparator methylates the target*. That assumption is paper-specific (the
Roth et al. samples happen to methylate `ESR1`/`GATA3` promoters in
MCF-10A); it does not generalize to bulk adjacent-normal cohorts or even
to MCF-10A at gene-body probes.

`p_diff` replaces an absolute-threshold claim about the normal side with a
differential claim about the contrast, which is cohort-agnostic.

---

## 3. Empirical readout (MCF-7 vs MCF-10A surrogate)

| axis | AUC loose | AUC tight | P@100 loose | P@100 tight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V2.5 (δ=0.2) | **0.705** | **0.721** | tie-fragile | tie-fragile |
| V1 `final_score` | 0.657 | 0.628 | 0.040 | 0.030 |
| V2 `tumor_only` | 0.733 | 0.770 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| V2 `tumor_plus_normal_protection` | 0.503 | 0.488 | ≈0 | ≈0 |

AUC ordering: `tumor_only > V2.5 > V1 > v2_full`. The tumor_only edge on
AUC is paid for with total P@100 collapse; V2.5 trades some of that AUC
for a more biologically coherent composite.

### 3.1 The tie-fragility finding (the main reason V2.5 stays experimental)

On an `n=3` surrogate, `p_trust` saturates at `0.95 × 3/30 = 0.095` for
every EXACT-evidence candidate with ≥3 samples on each side. Candidates
whose `p_targ` and `p_diff` both round to ~1.0 — i.e. the *strongest*
differential candidates — all compose to exactly `0.095`. Direct
measurement on the scored artifact finds **519 records tied at the top
score**. Which 100 of those 519 appear in the top-100 depends entirely on
which tiebreak the benchmark uses:

| tiebreak | P@100 loose | P@100 tight |
|---|---|---|
| CLI default (Python stable sort on stream order) | 0.010 | 0.000 |
| Candidate-id lexicographic (heap) | 0.100 | 0.100 |

Neither is principled: the signal *inside* the tied band is zero. The
AUC metric is robust because ties contribute 0.5 each under Mann-Whitney
U, but P@K reads one deterministic subset of the ties.

`tumor_only` has the same pathology — its top is the same `0.095` band
minus the `p_diff` filter, i.e. mostly "always-unmethylated" loci. V1
`final_score` avoids the problem because it is continuous-real-valued and
does not bottleneck on a discrete `p_trust` ceiling.

**Implication.** On this cohort the V2.5 P@100 improvement over V1 is not
a robust empirical claim. On a cohort where `n ≫ trust_ramp_n` (e.g.
TCGA-BRCA `n ≈ 800`), `p_trust` is continuous and the tied band should
dissolve; V2.5's continuous `p_diff × p_targ` structure should then drive
a real ranking signal. That prediction is unvalidated.

## 4. Code-level audit

### 4.1 Math (`probabilistic.p_differential_protection`)

- **CDF form.** `0.5 × (1 − erf(z / √2))` equals `1 − Φ(z)`. Correct.
- **Z transformation.** `z = (δ − (μ_n − μ_t)) / σ_Δ`. Correct for
  `P(Δ > δ)` under `Δ ∼ N(μ_n − μ_t, σ_Δ²)`.
- **σ_Δ under independence.** `σ_Δ² = σ_t² + σ_n²`. Correct.
- **Boundary handling.** β-values live in [0, 1]; `Δ = β_n − β_t ∈ [−1, 1]`.
  The normal approximation ignores this boundary. In practice the model
  overestimates `p_diff` in the tails when μ_n − μ_t is near ±1. For
  δ ≤ 0.5 and IQRs of the scale seen on HM450 (~0.05–0.20), the error
  should be minor but is not formally bounded. Documented as a known
  modeling simplification.
- **σ floor.** The 0.05 floor prevents `σ_Δ → 0` when both IQRs collapse
  at boundary β-values (common for cg-islands methylated at 0 or 1). The
  effect is to widen `p_diff` into a softer probability at those loci
  rather than letting it spike to 1 or 0 on a razor edge. Value chosen
  empirically; not benchmarked against alternatives.
- **One-sided quantile case.** If only `q25` or only `q75` is present,
  the implementation sets `σ_k = 0` for that side and lets the floor
  take over. This is conservative but discards information. An
  improvement would be `σ = |q − μ| / 0.6745` from whichever quantile is
  present. Left as a follow-up because the surrogate has both quantiles
  on every record.

### 4.2 Dispatch (`probabilistic.probabilistic_score`)

- The new branch `elif mode == "tumor_plus_differential_protection":` is
  the only mode that sets `p_differential_protection` and
  `differential_delta` on the output record. Other branches leave both
  `None`, which is enforced by the `ProbabilisticScore` validator.
- `differential_delta` is accepted as a keyword-only argument and defaults
  to `DEFAULT_DIFFERENTIAL_DELTA`. It is ignored when the mode is not
  differential — no silent override path.
- `sigma_floor` is **not** exposed on `probabilistic_score`. It is only
  tunable on the low-level `p_differential_protection(…, sigma_floor=…)`
  call. Acceptable for now (no benchmark depends on varying it); flag as
  a potential knob to lift if tuning becomes interesting.

### 4.3 Model (`ProbabilisticScore` + `CohortConfig`)

- `ProbabilisticScore.p_differential_protection: float | None` and
  `differential_delta: float | None` default to `None`.
- The `@model_validator(mode="after")` enforces the biconditional:
  *audit fields populated iff mode is differential*. Both directions
  covered by tests. This prevents malformed records from silently
  round-tripping through JSONL in either direction.
- `ProbabilisticScore.p_therapeutic_selectivity` is a stored scalar, not
  a property — downstream consumers see the actual composite the mode
  emitted. The validator does **not** re-derive `p_sel` from the factors
  and verify consistency; i.e. a hand-constructed record with mode=
  differential, `p_diff=0.5`, `p_targ=0.5`, `p_trust=0.5` but
  `p_sel=0.9` would validate. This is a gap; fixing it would require
  either making `p_sel` a computed field or adding a cross-field check.
  Left for now because `probabilistic_score` is the only in-repo writer.
- `CohortConfig.differential_delta: float = 0.2` (ge=0.0, le=1.0).
  `extra="forbid"` continues to reject unknown keys, so V2.5 cannot
  silently absorb a typo.

### 4.4 Backward compatibility

- Old `scored_*.jsonl` artifacts (pre-V2.5) lack the two new fields.
  Pydantic fills them with `None` on re-load, the validator's "None
  when mode is not differential" branch passes, and the record is
  accepted unchanged. Verified by re-reading the committed
  `scored_surrogate_tumor_only.jsonl` in the offline script.
- V1 `final_score` path is bit-identical: the new mode is gated by
  `compute_probabilistic=True` and by the mode field. No V1-only path
  touches `p_differential_protection`.

### 4.5 Test coverage (`tests/test_probabilistic.py`, `tests/test_config.py`)

Covered:

- mode dispatch (differential differs from tumor_only when gap ≈ δ)
- δ recorded on the emitted score
- strict monotonicity: higher δ ⇒ smaller `p_diff` ⇒ smaller composite
- composite formula equals `p_targ × p_diff × p_trust` exactly
- non-differential modes leave audit fields `None`
- validator rejects: differential mode without audit fields; non-differential
  mode *with* audit fields
- YAML round-trip of `tumor_plus_differential_protection` + custom δ
- YAML rejects unknown mode strings at load
- `p_diff` monotone in gap size
- `p_diff = 0` on one-sided observations
- `p_diff = 0.5` at the breakpoint (gap = δ) — defining property of the factor
- `p_diff = 0` on UNOBSERVED

199 tests green.

Not covered (acknowledged gaps):

- The `sigma_floor` tunable parameter has no dedicated test; its effect
  is implicit in the breakpoint and monotonicity tests.
- Cross-field consistency between `p_therapeutic_selectivity` and the
  individual factors is not checked by the Pydantic model.
- The benchmark's tie-handling is not asserted — a regression could
  silently change P@K on tied bands.

### 4.6 Benchmark harness — tie handling

Not modified in V2.5. `evaluate_ranking` does
`pairs.sort(key=lambda t: t[1], reverse=True)` — stable sort, ties
preserve insertion order, which is the stream order from the JSONL. This
is deterministic but not principled on saturated cohorts. Follow-ups the
reviewer (user) called out:

- report tie-band size at the score cutoff on every `BenchmarkResult`
- optionally emit a P@K range (min/max over tied subsets) when the top-K
  boundary falls inside a tied band
- optionally allow a deterministic secondary key (e.g. `final_score`)
  as an explicit tie-break

None shipped in this patch. They are the right next engineering step
before any stronger public V2.5 claim.

---

## 5. Claims inventory — what we can and cannot say

**Can say:**

- V2.5 is a clean AUC improvement over V1 on the MCF-7/MCF-10A surrogate
  (+0.048 loose, +0.093 tight).
- V2.5 replaces a biologically mis-specified protection factor
  (`p_prot = P(β > 0.5)`, empirically anti-predictive) with a differential
  factor that makes no absolute-threshold assumption.
- The composite, the validator, the YAML surface, and the downstream
  records are internally consistent and contract-tested.
- V2.5 is opt-in; the default remains `tumor_only`; V1 `final_score`
  remains the recommended discovery ranking.

**Cannot say:**

- That V2.5 beats V1 on P@100 on this cohort. The apparent P@100 lead
  is inside a 519-record tied band driven by `p_trust` saturation on
  `n=3` summaries; tiebreak choice swings the reported value by an
  order of magnitude.
- That V2.5 is a production-ready ranking mode for target discovery.
  That claim needs a higher-replicate matched cohort (MCF-7/MCF-10A
  with `n` ≥ 30 per side, or a cell-line pair from a deeper series)
  where `p_trust` does not saturate.
- That V2.5 matches the Roth et al. validation scheme. The Roth paper
  cites GSE32256, which resolves to a non-human series; authors have
  been emailed and the actual accession is unknown.

---

## 6. What should happen before V2.5 can be released as default

1. **Higher-replicate matched cohort** where `p_trust` does not saturate.
   The `n`-dependence predicts the tied band dissolves around `n ≥ 30`.
2. **Benchmark tie-reporting.** `BenchmarkResult` gains a `tie_band_size`
   and a P@K range. This is the single highest-leverage follow-up and
   does not require new science.
3. **Roth author response.** Confirms or rules out GSE32256 as the
   source; unblocks whether "V2.5 is the paper-comparable validation
   path" is defensible.
4. **Second surrogate benchmark** on a different cell-line pair to rule
   out MCF-7/MCF-10A-specific artifacts before any V2.5 release claim.
5. **Stress the sigma_floor and one-sided-quantile paths** with real
   data where those cases actually occur.

None of these block the opt-in mode as-is on `main`. They block the
stronger public claim.

---

## 7. Decision record

- `v0.4.0` is the last stable release point. Default `probabilistic_mode`
  is `tumor_only`.
- V2.5 ships as opt-in on `main`. No tag, no release notes beyond this
  document and the `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section.
- README, CHANGELOG, model docstrings, and the README-linked practical
  guidance all state the conservative position explicitly.
- Follow-up engineering (tie reporting) is queued but not a blocker.
